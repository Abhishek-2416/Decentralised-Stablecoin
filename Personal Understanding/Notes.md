- Stablecoins is a crypto asset whose buying power stays relatively stable

## Categories/Properties
- Relative Stablility (Pegged/Anchored or Floating)
- Stability Method (Goverened or Algorithmic)
- Collateral Type (Endogenous or Exogenous)

## Pegged and floating

- Pegged Stablecoins have their value tied to another asset
- While floating stablecoins use math and other mechanism to maintain a constant buying power

## Collateral Type
- Exogenous Collateral is collateral that originates from outside the protocol
- Endogenous Collateral is which originates from inside the protocol

- If the collateral was created with the sole purpose of being a collateral it is a big red flag and to be a scam
- But if that is the issue why do people make endogenous collateral stablecoins, they do this because they can scale at a much higher rate than others
